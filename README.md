# Code-BootCamp-C-and-CPP
A 2 days code boot-camp for first year undergraduate students.

### Short Description:
-----
We are going to model a couple of problems in this boot-camp through basic vector algebra and sets, its all about high school/first year level of mathematics. The problems are related to the wrong spelled words in a text file and the auto suggestions  for an incomplete word of English while typing through keyboard.

The goal of the boot-camp is to have live experience in modeling and writing a software library component  in C/C++. An IDE for C/C++ like CLion[https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/], CodeBlocks[https://www.codeblocks.org/] or VSCode[https://code.visualstudio.com/] with GCC/G++ (preferred C++11) compiler configuration would be highly recommended.

We use multi-files project for the component development, i.e. multiple part of codes are organized through headers and their respective file sources.
